Encrypter and Decrypter written in Python
1. Run the Python script and select the type of operation.
2. Enter the absolute path of the folder you want to encrypt and decrypt.
Eg. Windows:"C:\Documents\Your_folder_name" and Linux: "/root/Your_folder_name"
3.Encryption is a fast process and wait for the process to take place while Decryption takes a little more time.
####### Always make sure to create a copy of data you want to encrypt in case of any error###############
